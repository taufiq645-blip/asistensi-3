The resources/lang directory is intended for localization files. To create the initial structure for the "StockTrack" project, you can create a default language file for English. Here are the contents for the file:

/StockTrack/StockTrack/resources/lang/en/messages.php

<?php

return [
    'welcome' => 'Welcome to StockTrack!',
    'inventory' => 'Inventory Management',
    'add_item' => 'Add Item',
    'edit_item' => 'Edit Item',
    'delete_item' => 'Delete Item',
    'item_added' => 'Item has been added successfully.',
    'item_updated' => 'Item has been updated successfully.',
    'item_deleted' => 'Item has been deleted successfully.',
    'no_items' => 'No items found in the inventory.',
];
